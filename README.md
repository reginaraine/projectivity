## Projectivity aims to improve the productivity of students completing projects. A homepage leads to 3 pages where students can manage their tasks, time and resources. The web application features a music player, task list, kanban board, stopwatch, flow time tracker and resource list creator.

## As it is only a prototype, there are definite improvements required before further publishing. These include refining the responsive design layout, improving the code hierachy and making the backend server more organised and complete.
